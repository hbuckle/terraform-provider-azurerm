# azurerm_batch_pool

Manages an Azure Batch pool.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "testaccbatch"
  location = "%s"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "test" {
  name                     = "testaccsa"
  resource_group_name      = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location                 = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_batch_account" "test" {
  name                 = "testaccbatch"
  resource_group_name  = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  location             = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.location}"
  pool_allocation_mode = "BatchService"
  storage_account_id   = "${azurerm_storage_account.test.id}"

  tags {
    env = "test"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_batch_pool" "test" {
  name                = "testaccpool"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.test.name}"
  account_name        = "${azurerm_batch_account.test.name}"
  display_name        = "Test Acc Pool Auto"
  vm_size             = "Standard_A1"
  node_agent_sku_id   = "batch.node.ubuntu 16.04"

      pendingTaskSamples = pendingTaskSamplePercent < 70 ? startingNumberOfVMs : avg($PendingTasks.GetSample(180 *   TimeInterval_Second));
      $TargetDedicatedNodes=min(maxNumberofVMs, pendingTaskSamples);

  }

    max_task_retry_count = 1
    wait_for_success     = true

    environment {
      env = "TEST"
    }

    user_identity {
      auto_user {

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Batch pool. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Batch pool. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Batch account in which the pool will be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `node_agent_sku_id` - (Required) Specifies the Sku of the node agents that will be created in the Batch pool.

* `vm_size` - (Required) Specifies the size of the VM created in the Batch pool.

* `storage_image_reference` - (Required) A `storage_image_reference` for the virtual machines that will compose the Batch pool.

* `display_name` - (Optional) Specifies the display name of the Batch pool.

* `max_tasks_per_node` - (Optional) Specifies the maximum number of tasks that can run concurrently on a single compute node in the pool. Defaults to `1`.

* `fixed_scale` - (Optional) A `fixed_scale` block that describes the scale settings when using fixed scale.

* `auto_scale` - (Optional) A `auto_scale` block that describes the scale settings when using auto scale.

* `start_task` - (Optional) A `start_task` block that describes the start task settings for the Batch pool.

~> **Please Note:** `fixed_scale` and `auto_scale` blocks cannot be used both at the same time.

---

A `fixed_scale` block supports the following:

* `target_dedicated_nodes` - (Optional) The number of nodes in the Batch pool. Defaults to `1`.

* `target_low_priority_nodes` - (Optional) The number of low priority nodes in the Batch pool. Defaults to `0`.

* `resize_timeout` - (Optional) The timeout for resize operations. Defaults to `PT15M`.

--- 

A `auto_scale` block supports the following:

* `evaluation_interval` - (Optional) The interval to wait before evaluating if the pool needs to be scaled. Defaults to `PT15M`.

* `formula` - (Required) The autoscale formula that needs to be used for scaling the Batch pool.

---

A `start_task` block exports the following:

* `command_line` - (Required) The command line executed by the start task.

* `max_task_retry_count` - (Optional) The number of retry count. Defaults to `1`.

* `wait_for_success` - (Optional) A flag that indicates if the Batch pool should wait for the start task to be completed. Default to `false`.

* `environment` - (Optional) A map of strings (key,value) that represents the environment variables to set in the start task.

* `user_identity` - (Required) A `user_identity` block that describes the user identity under which the start task runs.

---

A `user_identity` block exports the following:

* `user_name` - (Optional) The username to be used by the Batch pool start task.

* `auto_user` - (Optional) A `auto_user` block that describes the user identity under which the start task runs.

~> **Please Note:** `user_name` and `auto_user` blocks cannot be used both at the same time, but you need to define one or the other.

---

A `auto_user` block exports the following:

* `elevation_level` - (Optional) The elevation level of the user identity under which the start task runs. Possible values are `Admin` or `NonAdmin`. Defaults to `NonAdmin`.

* `scope` - (Optional) The scope of the user identity under which the start task runs. Possible values are `Task` or `Pool`. Defaults to `Task`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Batch pool ID.
